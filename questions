### 1. UDP vs TCP
Which of the following statements best describes the difference between UDP and TCP?

A. TCP is faster than UDP because it skips acknowledgments  
B. UDP guarantees delivery and order of packets  
**C. TCP ensures reliable delivery, while UDP prioritizes speed over reliability**  
D. UDP uses a three-way handshake before sending data  

**Explanation:**  
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides connection-oriented, reliable delivery using acknowledgments and retransmissions.  
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless and faster but doesn’t guarantee delivery or order.

### 2. Type of Attack
What type of attack attempts to overwhelm a server by flooding it with traffic?

A. Phishing  
**B. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**  
C. SQL Injection  
D. Brute-force  

**Explanation:**  
A DDoS attack sends huge amounts of traffic from many sources to overload a system, making it unavailable to real users.

### 3. Docker Basics
Which command is used to list all running Docker containers?

A. docker ps -a  
**B. docker ps**  
C. docker images  
D. docker start  

**Explanation:**

### 4. Linux Command
Which Linux command is used to view system logs?

A. cat /etc/passwd  
**B. journalctl -xe**  
C. top  
D. df -h  

**Explanation:**

### 5. Ports
Which port does HTTPS typically use?

A. 21  
B. 80  
**C. 443**  
D. 3389  

**Explanation:**  
Port 443 is used for secure web traffic (HTTPS).  
Port 80 is for HTTP, 21 for FTP, and 3389 for Remote Desktop (RDP).

### 6. Ports
What port is commonly used by DNS?

A. 22  
**B. 53**  
C. 25  
D. 8080  

**Explanation:**  
Port 53 is used by the Domain Name System (DNS) for translating domain names to IP addresses.

### 7. VLAN
What is the primary purpose of a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)?

A. To connect computers using Wi-Fi  
**B. To logically segment a network without needing separate physical switches**  
C. To provide encryption between devices  
D. To control incoming and outgoing traffic like a firewall  

**Explanation:**  
A VLAN divides a single physical network into multiple logical networks — improving security and organization.

---

### 8. Firewall
Which of the following best describes a firewall?

A. A device that speeds up internet connections  
**B. A security system that filters and controls network traffic**  
C. A protocol used for file transfers  
D. A device used to assign IP addresses  

**Explanation:**  
A firewall inspects and filters network packets based on rules — allowing or blocking traffic for security.
