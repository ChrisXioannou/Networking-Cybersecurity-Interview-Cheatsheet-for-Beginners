## Introduction

![Diagram1](https://github.com/ChrisXioannou/Networking-Cybersecurity-Interview-Cheatsheet-for-Beginners/blob/main/assets/diagram1.png)

**You don’t need to master everything — you just need to understand the fundamentals.**  
That’s the real key to interviews in both networking and cybersecurity — two broad, fast-evolving fields.

As Einstein wisely said: *“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”*

Specialization will come with company training and hands-on experience.  
Right now, your goal is to show that you *grasp the bigger picture.*

**This guide collects:**
- Essential networking and cybersecurity concepts  
- Simple tricks and mental models to remember them  
- Real interview questions I’ve been asked throughout my journey  

Use it to review, refresh, and prepare — **fast and effectively.**


## Logs

Logs are one of the most important topics in cybersecurity and networking.  
Whether you’re **troubleshooting a problem**, **investigating a threat**, or simply trying to **understand how something works** — logs are your best friend.

### What is a log?
A **log** is a recorded event — a timestamped message that describes something that happened on a system or network.  
Every device, service, and application generates logs: user logins, failed authentications, system errors, connections made, packets dropped, and so on.

They help answer questions like:
- Who did what, and when?  
- What failed or succeeded?  
- Is there something unusual happening?

**Example of a log entry:**

Oct 10 09:42:15 webserver sshd[1532]: Failed password for root from 192.168.1.45 port 51812 ssh2

## How to View Logs

There are many systems and tools that collect or manage logs
But in interviews, you usually won’t be asked to explain those in depth.  

A **very common question** is simply:
> “How do you view logs in Linux or Windows?”

This is a core question every candidate should be able to answer confidently — and it’s easy to practice yourself.

###  Windows
The built-in tool for viewing logs is **Event Viewer**, you can open it by simply searching for it from the Windows taskbar.
It lets you review **System**, **Security**, and **Application** logs in a structured way.

💡 Tip: You can filter logs by time, level (error/warning/info), or event ID.

### Linux
Linux systems log events to files under `/var/log/` or through **systemd’s journal**.

The most common way to view logs on modern systems is with the **`journalctl`** command:

# View recent logs
journalctl -xe

### Log Management Concepts

Many companies that offer cybersecurity services typically set up a **SIEM** tool.  
If you understand how logs work, then you already understand the foundation of what a SIEM does.

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):**  

A SIEM collects, normalizes, and correlates logs from multiple sources (such as servers, firewalls,network devices).

It analyzes those logs in real time to detect suspicious behavior, generate alerts, and provide dashboards.

In simple terms:  
- **Logs** record what happens.  
- **SIEMs** connect and analyze those records to identify what matters.  

Another important tool related to logs is an **IPS**.  
If you understand how a SIEM works, you can easily grasp the concept of an IPS as well.

**IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):**  
An IPS monitors network traffic for signs of malicious activity or policy violations.

But unlike a SIEM, it can take action! ( **block**, **reject**, or **quarantine** suspicious packets in real time). 

In short:
- **SIEM** — central brain analyzing logs from everywhere.  
- **IPS** — guards the network in real time.  

**Another common question** can simply be:
> “What's the difference between SIEM and IPS?”

## Responding to Detected Threats

When discussing tools that help us analyze logs and detect threats, a natural question arises:  
**What should we do if we actually detect a threat?**

**NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)**, a government agency that develops widely used frameworks and guidelines for cybersecurity has already answered that question with a general workflow that many companies follow.

Employers love to hear this, because it shows you understand the structured approach behind incident response.  

Even though the specific process may vary from one organization to another, these general principles apply everywhere.  
I highly suggest you learn this exactly as it is.

### According to NIST:

1. **Detect** – Spot unusual or malicious activity.  
2. **Analyze** – Confirm and understand the threat.  
3. **Contain** – Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.  
4. **Eradicate** – Remove the threat completely.  
5. **Recover** – Restore normal operations safely.  
6. **Learn & Improve** – Review what happened and strengthen defenses for the future.

### Think of it as a story

To make it easier to remember, think of it like trying to deal with a bug flying around your house:

- You first **spot it** (Detect).  
- Then you **see what it is** — a harmless butterfly or a mosquito? (Analyze).  
- “Oh no, I just got bit!”  
- You **close the door** so it doesn’t escape (Contain).  
- You **kill it** (Eradicate).  
- You **treat the bite** with some cold water or cream (Recover).  
- And next time, you’ll be **faster and more prepared** (Learn & Improve).

Each concept in networking and cybersecurity — and even in life — can be simplified with a story.  
Don’t get lost in every technical detail!

💡 **Reminder:** Interviewers want to see that you understand the *bigger picture*.

## Domain Controller and Active Directory

Imagine working in a company with hundreds of employees.  
How do you manage what everyone can access, what permissions they have, and which devices belong to whom?  
That’s where **domains** and **Active Directory** come in.

### What is a Domain?
A **domain** is a networked environment where all users, computers, and resources (like printers or shared folders) are managed under a single set of rules and permissions.  
It allows centralized control — meaning you can manage everything from one place instead of configuring each computer individually.

### How Do You Manage a Domain?
The most common way to manage a domain in Windows environments is through **Active Directory (AD)**, which runs on a **Domain Controller (DC)**.

### What is Active Directory?
**Active Directory** is a directory service developed by Microsoft.  
It stores information about users, devices, and resources, and defines how they can interact with each other within the network.  
Think of it as a company-wide database of identities and permissions.

When someone logs in to a company computer, their credentials (username and password) are checked against the database inside Active Directory.  
If they match, access is granted.  
In most cases, the username is assigned by the administrator, while the user sets their password when they join the company.

### What Are Groups in Active Directory?
Groups are used to organize users and devices based on their roles or access needs.  
Instead of assigning permissions to each user individually, permissions are assigned to a **group**, and users inherit those permissions automatically.

For example:
- A “CEO” group might have access to confidential company files.  
- An “Interns” group might only access shared folders and basic tools.

### Users and Devices in AD
Each employee has both:
- A **user account**, which represents their identity.  
- A **device object**, which represents the computer they use.

When you connect a new device to the domain, it appears as an **object** in Active Directory.  
You then assign it to the correct group — for example, the CEO’s laptop goes to the “Executive Devices” group, while an intern’s workstation goes to the “Intern Computers” group.

This way, both **users and their devices** are organized and controlled centrally.

A **typical question** can look like this: 
> “What's the right group to add this user?”

💡 Understanding how **Active Directory** and **Domain Controllers** work shows interviewers that you grasp one of the most essential parts of corporate network management.

## Actions and Permissions

Previously, we mentioned how **groups** help us manage many users at once.  
By adding users to a group, they automatically **inherit the policies and restrictions** assigned to that group.

Now, what kind of actions or restrictions can we actually apply to users?  
Let’s understand this through one of the most essential Linux commands: **`chmod`**.

### Understanding `chmod`

The `chmod` command (short for *change mode*) is used to modify file and directory permissions in Linux.  
It defines **who** can perform **what kind of actions** on a file.

Every file in Linux has three sets of permissions, each represented by three letters:

| Section | Who it applies to | Example |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| **u** (user) | The owner of the file | The person who created it |
| **g** (group) | Users in the same group as the owner | Team members or department |
| **o** (others) | Everyone else on the system | Any other user |

Each of these can have three types of access:
- **r** → Read (view the contents)  
- **w** → Write (edit or delete the file)  
- **x** → Execute (run the file if it’s a script or program)

### Example: `chmod rwx-rw-r--`

Let’s break it down:

| Section | Who | Permissions | Meaning |
|----------|------|--------------|----------|
| `rwx` | User (owner) | Read, Write, Execute | Full control over the file |
| `rw-` | Group | Read, Write | Can view and edit, but not execute |
| `r--` | Others | Read only | Can view the file but not modify it |

So in this example:
- The **owner** can do everything.  
- The **group** can read and modify.  
- **Others** can only read.

💡 The most important cybersecurity concept here is **limiting privileges** — never give more access than necessary.

A **key question** can be:
> “Write a Linux command to only allow the creator to read, write, and execute on this file.”


## Safety

Cybersecurity isn’t just about tools and commands — it’s about protecting information.
Every action you take, from setting file permissions to encrypting data, serves a purpose: to keep systems secure and reliable.

At the core of this purpose lies a simple but powerful concept.

### **The CIA Triad**

The CIA Triad represents the three fundamental goals of cybersecurity:
**Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.**
Every security control, policy, or defense mechanism exists to protect at least one of these.

**Confidentiality** → Keeping data secret from unauthorized access.
Example: Encryption, access controls, and authentication ensure that only approved users can view sensitive information.

**Integrity** → Making sure data remains accurate and unaltered.
Example: Hashing and digital signatures detect unauthorized modifications — if the data changes, the hash changes too.

**Availability** → Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.
Example: Backups, redundant systems, and DDoS protection keep services running even during failures or attacks.

![Diagram2](https://github.com/ChrisXioannou/Networking-Cybersecurity-Interview-Cheatsheet-for-Beginners/blob/main/assets/diagram3.png)

💡 Think of it this way:
If confidentiality, integrity, or availability is lost — security is broken.
That’s why the CIA Triad is the foundation of every cybersecurity strategy.

### **Passwords and 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**

Passwords are the first layer of protection, but they’re not always enough — they can be guessed, stolen, or leaked.  
That’s why modern systems use **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**.

With 2FA, users must provide **two forms of verification**:
1. **Something they know** — like a password.  
2. **Something they have** — like a phone, app code, or security key.

Even if someone steals your password, they still can’t log in without that second factor.

💡 **Fact:** 2FA has prevented millions of unauthorized logins and remains one of the simplest yet most effective security measures — and interviewers love to ask about it.

### **Encryption**

What if, even after setting permissions and groups, a user still manages to access something they shouldn’t?  
That’s where **security layers** like authentication and encryption come in.

Even if an attacker gains access to your data, **encryption** ensures they can’t actually read it.  
Encryption converts plain, readable data (**plaintext**) into a scrambled format (**ciphertext**) using a **key**.

Only someone with the correct key can decrypt it and view the original information.

In short:
> **Encryption protects data in case it falls into the wrong hands.**

### **Hashing**

While encryption can be reversed (using a key), hashing cannot.
Hashing converts data into a unique, fixed-length value called a hash — like a digital fingerprint of the file or text.

Even a tiny change in the original data (like adding a single space or letter) completely changes the resulting hash.
That’s why hashing is often used to verify integrity and ensure that no one has tampered with a file or message.

For example:

When verifying file integrity (like a downloaded update or backup), comparing its hash to the original confirms that the file hasn’t been modified or corrupted.

💡 Think of it this way:
If the hash changes, the file has changed — even if the difference is invisible to the eye.

## Networks

We’ve mentioned networking several times already, but what exactly **is** networking — and how does it work?

Networking is the process of connecting computers and devices so they can communicate and share data.  
It relies on **protocols**, which act as the rules that define how information travels from one point to another.

### Protocols

A **protocol** is a predefined set of rules that determines how data is formatted, transmitted, and received across a network.  

Without protocols, one device’s “language” would be completely different from another’s.  
Protocols bring **order, structure, and compatibility** to digital communication.

Imagine a game of football — the game itself is networking, but without the rules (protocols), players wouldn’t know how to pass, score, or even start the match.


### Common Protocols and Concepts

💡 The only prerequisite to understanding these is knowing what an **IP address** and a **MAC address** are.

- **IP (Internet Protocol)**  
  An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device on a network.  
  It identifies *where* a device is located so data can be sent to the correct destination — like a digital home address.

- **MAC (Media Access Control) Address**  
  A MAC address is a hardware identifier embedded in a device’s network interface card (NIC).  
  While IP addresses can change, a MAC address is permanent and unique to each device.

- **Subnet Mask**  
  The subnet mask determines which part of the IP address refers to the **network** and which part refers to the **device (host)**.  
  For example, in `192.168.1.10` with a mask of `255.255.255.0`, the `192.168.1` identifies the network, and `.10` is the specific host.

- **Default Gateway**  
  The default gateway is the device (usually your router) that connects your local network to other networks or the internet.  
  When your computer wants to reach an IP outside its own network, it sends the data to the gateway, which forwards it to the destination.

#### **DNS (Domain Name System)**
DNS translates human-readable domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses (like `142.250.190.78`).  
Without DNS, you would have to memorize IP addresses for every website you visit.

#### **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
ARP is used to map an IP address to a physical MAC address on a local network.  
In simple terms, it helps devices find each other within the same network.

#### **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
When you connect to a network, DHCP automatically assigns your device an IP address and provides other network details (like the DNS server and default gateway).  
It eliminates the need to manually configure each device.

#### **NAT (Network Address Translation)**
NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share one public IP address when accessing the internet.  
It hides internal IPs and adds a layer of security by preventing direct access from outside.

#### **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
UDP sends data faster but without guaranteeing delivery.  
It’s used for applications where speed matters more than reliability — like video streaming, online gaming, or voice calls.

#### **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**
TLS provides encryption and authentication between two systems.  
It sits between HTTP and TCP, ensuring the data being sent is private and hasn’t been tampered with.

#### **HTTP / HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol / Secure)**
HTTP defines how web pages are transmitted between a client and a server.  
HTTPS is simply HTTP running over TLS — meaning it’s encrypted and secure.

### 💬 Fun Example — TCP vs UDP

To truly understand TCP, it helps to see its personality.

TCP cares about **delivery confirmation** — it keeps asking, “Did you receive it?”  
UDP, on the other hand, just sends the message and doesn’t care if you ever got it.

Here’s a perfect example from a popular networking joke online:

> **TCP/IP Joke:**  
> “Do you want to hear a joke about TCP/IP?”  
> “Yes, I’d like to hear a joke about TCP/IP.”  
> “Are you ready to hear the joke about TCP/IP?”  
> “I am ready to hear the joke about TCP/IP.”  
> “Here is a joke about TCP/IP.”  
> “Did you receive the joke about TCP/IP?”  
> “I have received the joke about TCP/IP.”  
> “Excellent. You have received the joke about TCP/IP. Goodbye.”

> **UDP Joke:**  
> “Here’s a joke about UDP… but I don’t care if you get it.”

This perfectly illustrates the difference:
- **TCP:** Reliable, connection-oriented, confirms delivery.  
- **UDP:** Fast, connectionless, doesn’t confirm anything.

### Protocol Summary Table

💡 You can answer almost any multiple-choice question about protocols just by looking at this summary table.

| Concept | Full Name | Purpose |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **DNS** | Domain Name System | Converts domain names to IPs |
| **ARP** | Address Resolution Protocol | Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses |
| **DHCP** | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol | Automatically assigns IPs to devices |
| **NAT** | Network Address Translation | Allows many devices to share one public IP |
| **UDP** | User Datagram Protocol | Fast, connectionless data transfer |
| **TLS** | Transport Layer Security | Encrypts communication between systems |
| **HTTP / HTTPS** | Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure) | Transfers web data (encrypted if HTTPS) |
| **IP** | Internet Protocol | Handles add

## Ports

All this networking wouldn’t be possible without **ports**.  
They are the specific entry and exit points through which data travels to and from applications on a device.

Imagine a house without doors — how would you enter or receive visitors?  
In the same way, without ports, computers wouldn’t know **where** to send or receive specific types of data.

Each port can be configured based on system or application needs,  
but some ports are **standardized** and recognized worldwide — these are known as **well-known ports**.

As we mentioned each device on a network is identified by an **IP address**, which tells *where* the device is located.
A single device can run many different services at once — web servers, email servers, remote access tools, and more.  
So, how does the network know **which service** the data should go to?

That’s where **ports** come in!

- The **IP address** identifies the **device**.  
- The **port number** identifies the **specific application or service** running on that device.

### Port Summary Table

| Port | Protocol | Service / Description |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| **20 / 21** | FTP | File Transfer Protocol – transfer of files between systems |
| **22** | SSH | Secure Shell – encrypted remote access and file transfer |
| **25** | SMTP | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol – sending emails |
| **53** | DNS | Domain Name System – resolves names to IPs |
| **67 / 68** | DHCP | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol – assigns IPs dynamically |
| **80** | HTTP | Web traffic (unencrypted) |
| **443** | HTTPS | Secure web traffic (HTTP over TLS/SSL) |
| **514** | Syslog (UDP/TCP) | Collects and forwards system and network logs |
| **3389** | RDP | Remote Desktop Protocol – remote graphical access to Windows systems |
| **8080** | HTTP (alternate) | Alternative web traffic port often used by proxy servers |

💡 Knowing these ports not only helps in interviews but also when analyzing traffic, troubleshooting connectivity, or identifying potential attacks during a network scan.

## Firewall

At home, your **router** usually handles multiple services — it acts as your **NAT**, **DHCP**, and **DNS** provider all at once.  
But in a company environment, a **dedicated firewall** is often set up to take over these responsibilities and apply stricter control.  
It becomes the central point for managing and securing all incoming and outgoing network traffic.

A **firewall** controls the flow of network traffic based on predefined rules.  
It decides which connections are **allowed**, **blocked**, or **monitored**, protecting your network from unauthorized or malicious access.

In simple terms:  
> A firewall adds **policies** to all network connections — deciding what gets in and what stays out.

Much like an **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**, it can:
- Block suspicious or unauthorized traffic  
- Allow only specific ports (like 80 and 443 for web browsing)  
- Deny inbound requests while allowing outbound ones  
- Log all traffic attempts for later analysis  

Firewalls can exist as:
- **Hardware devices** (built into routers or dedicated network appliances)
- **Software firewalls** (running on your operating system)
- **Cloud-based firewalls** (used in enterprise and modern infrastructures)

## OSI Model

We’ve talked about many protocols, ports, and policies — and all of them need to work **the same way across different systems**.  
That’s why the **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)** was created:  
to standardize how different devices and software communicate, regardless of who built them.

So, the OSI model gives structure to your troubleshooting process — layer by layer.

### The Seven Layers of the OSI Model

| Layer | Name | Description | Example Protocols / Technologies |
|-------|------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **7** | **Application** | Where users and applications interact with the network. | HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP, SMTP |
| **6** | **Presentation** | Translates, encrypts, and compresses data so applications can understand it. | TLS/SSL, JPEG, MP3 |
| **5** | **Session** | Manages sessions (connections) between applications. | NetBIOS, RPC |
| **4** | **Transport** | Provides reliable or fast data delivery using TCP or UDP. | TCP, UDP |
| **3** | **Network** | Handles logical addressing and routing of packets. | IP, ICMP, ARP |
| **2** | **Data Link** | Responsible for node-to-node data transfer and MAC addressing. | Ethernet, PPP, VLANs |
| **1** | **Physical** | Deals with actual hardware transmission — cables, signals, and bits. | Ethernet cables, Fiber, Hubs |


![Diagram3](https://github.com/ChrisXioannou/Networking-Cybersecurity-Interview-Cheatsheet-for-Beginners/blob/main/assets/diagram2.png)


### Why It Matters

It’s not only about making protocols compatible.  
The OSI model also helps us **troubleshoot**.

For example:
- If your **encryption** works but data doesn’t reach the destination, you might have a problem in the **transport** or **network layer**.  
- If your **application** won’t connect but the network is fine, the issue might be in the **application** or **presentation** layer.  

### How to Remember the Layers

A classic mnemonic (from Layer 7 → Layer 1):

> **A**ll **P**eople **S**eem **T**o **N**eed **D**ata **P**rocessing

or in reverse (Layer 1 → Layer 7):

> **P**lease **D**o **N**ot **T**hrow **S**ausage **P**izza **A**way

A useful way to remember where each protocol belongs is to **think logically rather than memorize**.

Each protocol naturally fits into a layer based on what it does.

For example:
We previously said that **TCP** is responsible for creating the **connection** between two devices — so it must live **below** something like **HTTP**, which only works *after* a connection exists to send and receive data!  

So how can HTTP (which presents and transfers information) exist without TCP first establishing that reliable path?  
It can’t — that’s why HTTP is **above** TCP.

And how can TCP even function without **IP**, which provides the logical addressing that tells it where to send data?  
It can’t — so IP must be **below** TCP.

Finally, how could IP work if there was no **Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi signal** to actually move the bits?  
It couldn’t — that’s the **Physical Layer**.

💡 **Remember:** Don’t memorize the OSI model — **understand the logic behind it.**  
Every layer depends on the one below it to function.  
Learning to think in layers is one of the most powerful skills in networking and cybersecurity.

## Fundamental Protocols

There are a few **core protocols** that interviewers love to ask about.  
not because they’re random, but because they are the **foundation** of how all networks function.  

Let’s go a bit deeper into two of the most important ones: **TCP** and **DHCP**.
Which will also help you truly understand how communication actually happens in a network.

### **1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

**TCP** is one of the most critical protocols on the internet.  
It ensures **reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery** of data between two devices.

You can think of TCP as the “guaranteed delivery service” of networking.  
Before any data is transferred, both sides must first agree to communicate — this is done using the famous **Three-Way Handshake**.

### **How TCP Works – The Three-Way Handshake**

When a client wants to connect to a server (for example, when your browser connects to `google.com`):

1. **SYN (Synchronize)** – The client sends a message asking to start a connection.  
2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)** – The server replies saying “Got it, ready to connect.”  
3. **ACK (Acknowledge)** – The client confirms, and the connection is officially established.

At this point, data can flow in both directions **reliably**.

When the communication is done, a similar process (called the **four-way termination**) gracefully closes the connection.

💡 **Remember:** TCP sacrifices speed for **reliability**, ensuring every packet arrives in order and without errors.

### **2. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**

You may have noticed in the OSI model that there is no **DHCP**
DHCP deserves its own explanation because it works a bit differently than other protocols.

When a new device connects to a network, it doesn’t have an IP address yet.  
So how can it communicate with anything — especially before TCP even starts?

That’s where **broadcasts** come in.

### **How DHCP Works**

When you connect your laptop or phone to a Wi-Fi network:

1. **DHCP Discover** – Your device sends a *broadcast message* saying,  
   “Is there any DHCP server out there who can give me an IP?”  
2. **DHCP Offer** – The DHCP server replies with an available IP address and network details.  
3. **DHCP Request** – The client says “Yes, I’d like that one.”  
4. **DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK)** – The server confirms, and the device can now use that IP.

### **Why DHCP Doesn’t Use TCP**

TCP requires an IP address to create a connection in the first place.  
But DHCP’s job **is to assign that IP**.  
That’s why DHCP runs over **UDP** instead of TCP.

UDP doesn’t require a connection setup, making it **faster and simpler** for these short, essential exchanges.

💡 **Key takeaway:**  
- **TCP** ensures data is delivered correctly once a connection exists.  
- **DHCP** helps create that connection in the first place by giving devices their IP configuration.

## Hardware

Even though we are moving into a **virtualized** and **cloud-based** era, hardware still forms the backbone of every network.  
All those “cloud” services we rely on still live on **physical servers** somewhere in the world — the cloud is just **someone else’s data center**.

Understanding the key pieces of networking hardware helps you visualize how everything you’ve learned — IPs, ports, firewalls, and protocols — works in practice.

### **Essential Networking Hardware**

| Device | Purpose | OSI Layer |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Router** | Connects multiple networks together (e.g., your home network to the internet). Uses IP addresses to route packets. | Layer 3 – Network |
| **Switch** | Connects devices within a local network (LAN) and forwards data using MAC addresses. | Layer 2 – Data Link |
| **Hub** | Basic device that broadcasts data to all ports. Rarely used today. | Layer 1 – Physical |
| **Access Point (AP)** | Provides wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi) within a local area network. | Layer 2 – Data Link |
| **Server** | Hosts applications, websites, databases, and services for clients. | Layer 7 – Application |
| **Modem** | Converts digital signals from your router to analog signals for your ISP (and vice versa). | Layer 1 – Physical |

### **Virtualization Note**

Today, many of these hardware functions — routers, firewalls, switches, and even servers — are **virtualized**.  
That means they exist as **software-based systems** (like virtual machines or containers) instead of physical devices.  

However, no matter how advanced virtualization becomes, **the data still needs to pass through physical hardware**!
For example: **cables, network cards, and data center switches** that make the internet possible.

💡 **Remember:**  
Even the most “cloud-native” systems depend on physical infrastructure underneath.  
Hardware may be invisible — but it’s never gone.

## Attacks

Securing systems is complex — because **attacks are always evolving**.  
No matter how good the defenses are, new techniques appear constantly.  

In interviews, you might get a question like:  
> “Can you explain some common types of cyberattacks?”

### **1. Phishing**
Phishing is when an attacker tricks someone into revealing sensitive information —  
like passwords or credit card details — by pretending to be a trusted source.

Example:  
You receive an email that *looks like* it’s from your bank, asking you to log in urgently.  
The link leads to a fake website that steals your credentials.

**How to protect:**  
- Always verify the sender’s address.  
- Don’t click on links from unknown emails.  
- Enable 2FA — it neutralizes many phishing attempts.

### **2. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**
A DDoS attack overwhelms a target server or network with massive traffic,  
making it slow or completely unavailable to legitimate users.

Imagine millions of fake “visitors” hitting a website at the same time — it crashes under pressure.

**How to protect:**  
- Use firewalls and DDoS mitigation services (like Cloudflare).  
- Limit request rates and monitor traffic patterns.

### **3. Brute-Force Attack**
This attack tries **every possible combination** of passwords until the correct one is found.  
It’s simple but effective when passwords are weak.

**How to protect:**  
- Enforce strong password policies.  
- Implement account lockouts after several failed attempts.  
- Use CAPTCHA and 2FA.

### **4. SQL Injection**
An attacker inserts malicious SQL code into a website’s input fields (like a login form)  
to trick the database into revealing or modifying data.

Example:  
Typing `' OR 1=1 --` in a username field could bypass authentication if the input isn’t validated.

**How to protect:**  
- Use parameterized queries and input validation.  
- Never trust user input!

### **5. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**
In a MitM attack, the attacker secretly intercepts communication between two parties.  
They can eavesdrop, steal data, or even alter messages in transit.

**How to protect:**  
- Always use HTTPS (TLS encryption).  
- Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities.  
- Use VPNs for secure connections.

💡 **Interview Tip:**  
If asked about attacks, mention **both the concept and how to defend against it** —  
it shows you think like a cybersecurity professional, not just a student.

## Scenarios

Scenarios help you move from **theory to understanding** — they show how all these concepts actually work together in real life, not just in isolated definitions or protocols.

Let’s walk through a simple but powerful example.

### **Scenario 1: Visiting google.com for the first time**

1. **DNS Resolution:** Your device asks the DNS server for Google’s IP address to know where to connect.  
2. **TCP Handshake:** Once the IP is known, a 3-way handshake (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK) takes place to establish a reliable connection.  
3. **TLS Encryption:** Because it’s HTTPS, a secure TLS handshake happens next to encrypt all communication.  
4. **HTTP Request:** Your browser sends an HTTP request to ask for Google’s homepage.  
5. **Server Processing:** Google’s server processes the request and gathers everything needed to display the page.  
6. **Response Sent:** The server sends back HTML, CSS, images, and scripts.  
7. **Rendering:** Your browser interprets and renders the data so you can see the actual page.  
8. **Caching:** Certain files are cached locally for faster loading next time.

### **Scenario 2: Connecting to a company VPN**

1. **VPN Client Launches:** You open your VPN software — it knows which VPN server (IP) to contact.  
2. **Authentication:** The system verifies your credentials — often using a username, password, and sometimes 2FA.  
3. **RDP/Tunnel Setup:** A secure tunnel is created using **RAS (Remote Access Service)** or similar protocols.  
4. **Encryption:** All your traffic is encrypted, ensuring your company data can’t be intercepted.  
5. **DHCP Assignment:** Once connected, you receive a virtual IP address from the company’s DHCP server.  
6. **Firewall & Policy Enforcement:** The company firewall applies its rules, allowing or denying certain internal services.  
7. **Access Granted:** You can now safely access company files, internal websites, and remote desktops as if you were physically at the office.

💡 **Every step here** uses a mix of what you’ve learned!

Scenarios like these help you **see the flow** — from how a connection begins to how it’s secured, processed, and delivered.  

That’s the mindset interviewers love: not memorizing, but understanding *how everything fits together.*

## Final Notes: Theory That Completes the Picture

These were the core fundamentals — the most effective concepts to truly understand the basics of networking and cybersecurity.
They form the foundation that helps beginners not just memorize facts, but grasp how everything connects in the real world.
