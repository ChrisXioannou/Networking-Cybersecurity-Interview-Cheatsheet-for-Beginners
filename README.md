## **TOP PRIORITIES**

1. learn osi really well
2. linux ssh
3. A little bit more basic network questions
5. accorsing to nist
8. ports

Operating systems:

1. i learned journalctl for logs, and how to use it to specifically check for certain logs, certain times as well
2. learner the useradd and add user, how to add users basically and log files for them
3. Root User has all access in linux
   
General networking:

1. The dns chcp and nat services are provided by my rooter
2. Dns can help but if not there then i can refer to everything by ip
3. Nat takes place when it comes to helping the network go to the internet as one outside ip
4. Mask is basically a way to tell which part of the ip is important

note one or another
tcp (3 way handshake) 
udp what to send sends it and receives it
http lives on top of tcp, it gets used every time 
you can call an ip and the port that lives in it
layers go like http on top, ssl or tls in the middle and tcp on bottom
arp is for translating mac to ip and dns is ip to name
arp is layer 2.5 protocol
vlan is groups of devices connected
